Pneumonia Prediction using X-RAY images
This Project is Made by- Anand Mohan
This project is about detection of Pneumonia by using an chest X-Ray image of a patent .
By using this model we can precisely predict pneumonia. 
A convolutional neural network model is built from scratch to extract features from a given chest X-ray image and classify it to determine if a person is infected with pneumonia. a web is built where the user can upload the x - ray image and the result is shown on the UI whater he is dealing with pneumonia or not.
